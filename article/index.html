        <p>
          When you looking for a reduction in procurement time, errors, costs,
          and paperwork, a switch to e-procurement will be the best decision to
          take.
        </p>
        <h2>1. The definition of E-Procurement</h2>
        <p>
          According to The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS),
          e-procurement is:
        </p>
        <p>
          “The combined use of electronic information and communications
          technology to enhance the links between customer and supplier, and
          with other value chain partners, and thereby to improve external and
          internal processes. E- Procurement is a key component of the B2B
          e-commerce” Put differently, e-procurement improves both customer and
          supplier relationships, and strengthens their internal business
          processes, and could also offer significant cost savings, and more
          profit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The e-procurement value chain consists of indent management,
          e-Informing, e-Tendering, e-Auctioning, vendor management, catalogue
          management, Purchase Order Integration, Order Status, Ship Notice,
          e-invoicing, e- payment, and contract management.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, When e-procurement has started? Where did it come from? Are there
          any big companies using it?
        </p>
        <h2>2. The history of E-Procurement and When it began?</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the history of technology, we discover that the origins of
          e-procurement “B2B e-commerce” began in 1980, with the development of
          electronic data interchange (EDI), then the idea has improved and
          become somehow concrete in 1990 when software companies began to
          develop online catalogues specifically for use by vendors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then in the year 2000, IBM the American multinational technology
          company, was the first to use E-Procurement, as back then, the company
          launched its Replenishment Management System and Method, the system
          was created by the Mexican engineer Daniel Delfín who was the
          procurement director at IBM's largest production plant, and Alberto
          Wario, an IT programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system was designed to solve IBM's complex procurement process for
          the plant in Guadalajara, Mexico, the largest IBM laptop producing
          plant in the World back then, with a production value of 1.6 billion
          dollars a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three years after the system was implemented, the production of the
          plant grew to 3.6 billion dollars, after which, the company used the
          system in Germany, and later sold using licenses to other companies
          around the World.
        </p>
        <h2>
          3. Why E-Procurement is a revolutionary solution for the B2B industry
        </h2>
        <b>
          - business-to-business e-commerce is a $900 billion market in the
          United States alone(at 2018).
        </b>
        <p>
          The united states and Europe have adapted to E-Procurement since its
          early stages as they could see the great value from such technology,
          and that’s what already proved; B2B online sales will reach as much as
          $1.1 trillion in about two years, says Forrester Research Inc. (at
          2018), With e-commerce as a growing sales channel for B2B companies.
          It’s growing from day to day and that’s not by accident, as you know
          businesses don’t operate like that, especially when we talk about the
          biggest companies in USA or Europe, But they adopted to the
          E-Procurement technology because of its great value.
        </p>
        <h3>For The Supplier:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Increase B2B Sales</b> “EProcurement is the fastest growing B2B
            sales channel, increasing 37% annually” E-Procurement platforms and
            B2B Marketplaces are a game-changer for B2B suppliers as it helps
            them increase their sales massively by connecting them to buyers
            effortlessly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Increase Sales Globally, Not just locally</b>
            There’re some global E-Procurement Platforms and B2B Marketplaces
            which will allow you to increase your sales and grow globally, not
            just locally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Increase Sales Quickly</b>
            A great feature about E-Procurement Platforms and B2B Marketplaces
            is that they super super-saving time on each stage, makes
            communication faster, agreement faster, and shaking-hands faster.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For The Buyer:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Overcome Suppliers Problems</b>
            You may not find the perfect supplier with the quality you desire,
            but when using E- Procurement platform with a B2B marketplace, you
            can reach hundreds of suppliers locally and globally and send RFX as
            much as you need till finding your perfect supplier, all of this
            without moving out of your chair
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reduced Costs</b>
            E-procurement saves you money by preventing duplicate spending,
            leveraging volume buying, and saving you costs associated with
            paper-based systems (for example, the cost of stamps to mail your
            paperwork).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reduced Errors</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                E-procurement makes it easier for every department to conform to
                company procurement standards without any wastings.
              </li>
              <li>
                In addition to that, all the procurement documents will be
                online and thus easier to check for errors. Along with this,
                past orders are more easily referenced, meaning there’s a
                greater chance that your company can compare orders to ensure
                new ones are correct.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Increased Productivity</b>
            Once you’ve learned the system, e-procurement is less time-consuming
            than traditional procurement. Having your records stored
            electronically makes it easier to submit reusable tenders.
            Meanwhile, use of templates means paperwork can be filled out more
            quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Doing more in less time</b>
            E-procurement is both time-saving and efficient. As the electronic
            handling of tasks supports and simplifies the purchasing process,
            transaction speed is increased. Also, because of e-enabled
            relationships with suppliers, procurement cycle times speed up. The
            e-procurement process eliminates unnecessary activities, allowing
            you to focus on more valuable tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transparency</b>
            conducting your procurement online makes it easier to write and
            analyze reports and gives you a complete Knowledge of your
            purchasing process; e-procurement software will give you the
            visibility you want into your spending. The data e-procurement
            software gives you is critical.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. The Disadvantages of E-Procurement & How to Avoid them?</h2>

          With anything significant in the world must there be some risks, and
          of course with the great opportunities the E-Procurement provide,
          there’re some risks involved, but we’re gonna show you how to avoid
          it.
        </p>
